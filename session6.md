### Intro to APIs:
- HTTP Methods
    - GET : GET request, when you are getting something from a server, "can i get all of this information?"
    - POST : post request, posting it up, when someone is adding something to server, when a comment is added to a website
    - PUT/PATCH : patch up the problem, make a update
    - DELETE: can something on the server be deleted

### HTTP Status Codes
- 1XX
- 2XX - 200 ok, all good
- 3XX - 
- [4XX](https://http.cat) - 404 not sure what the client is requesting
- 5XX - 500 its not you, its me

### API
Ability to go to someone else's source of data because they might be offering a good source (only using my personal data when I am able to)

#### Cons to API
- you do not have much control over the API
- ex. if 
- database structure that a company is giving you access to you to use their data
